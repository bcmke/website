# Frequently Asked Quests (FAQ)

Here is a list of questions we get asked frequently? If your question isn't
answered here, please reach out and if it's asked frequently enough it'll get
added here!

## WHO CAN COME?

Anyone. Anyone who codes, designs, or wants to work on something cool. If you
don't already know how to do these things, you can spend the time learning how,
and show everyone what you learned. That's great too!

## CODE OF CONDUCT

BarCamp Milwaukee is dedicated to providing a harrasment-free event
experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression,
sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, or
religion. We do not tolerate harassment of event participants in any form.
Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any event venue. Event
participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the event
at the discretion of the event organizers.
[Read the extended Code of Conduct]({{< ref "/codeofconduct" >}}).

## CAN I COME WITHOUT AN IDEA?

Absolutely! You can join someone else's project, work on some coding
challenges, or dream up something on the spot. You can fiddle with anything
you've been tinkering with: prototype that business idea, prove to a co-worker
that your algorithm will work in that one special case, or make a gift for a
special someone.

## WHAT SHOULD I BRING?

Most people bring their laptops, chargers, and anything else they need to work
on their projects. Feel free to bring anything you need: a loom, a guitar,
etc. Just remember to be considerate of those that are working around you.

Tell us in advance if you plan to bring something that could be considered a
weapon, but anything else is fair game.

## WILL THERE BE FOOD?

Depends on sponsorship and will vary from event to event. We try to make sure
the event is near multiple food options in the event that we are unable to
find sponsors for food.

## DO I HAVE TO TALK IN FRONT OF EVERYONE?

Nope, no pressure at all. We always love to see what cool stuff people are
making, but we understand public presentations aren't for everyone. If you do
present, we ask that you keep it short and sweet and under three minutes. A
good general format is:

> I made ________, and it does ________. I worked on it because  ________ and
> it is made with ________. Before today, I had done ________, and today I
> worked on ________.
